[Kava](https://www.kava.io/) is the first Layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and scalability of the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main) with the developer support of 
[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/)  &nbsp;  
 
This repository serves as a starting guide to get you started with creating Decentralised Applications (dApps) on Kava. &nbsp; 
   
This repository also serves as a codebase for the [video playlist]() we have made about 'How to create a dApp on Kava' from scratch &nbsp; 
   


The dApps created till now include :
- [simple flipper dApp](https://github.com/Blockchain-Prime/Kava/tree/main/kava-flipper-dapp-main)
- [token sender dApp](https://github.com/Blockchain-Prime/Kava/tree/main/kava-token-sender-main)
