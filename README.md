[Kava](https://www.kava.io/) is the first Layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and scalability of the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main) with the developer support of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) ü§ù  &nbsp;  
 
This repository contains a list of Decentralised Applications (dApps) built on KAVA Network which you can use as starting ideas to start building EVM dApps on [KAVA](https://github.com/kava-labs)  &nbsp; 

üìú dApps that you can check out :
- [simple flipper dApp](https://github.com/Blockchain-Prime/Kava/tree/main/kava-flipper-dapp-main)
- [token sender dApp](https://github.com/Blockchain-Prime/Kava/tree/main/kava-token-sender-main)  &nbsp;   
&nbsp; 

To help you get started with bulding your first **fullstack dApp** on Kava Network, we have created this [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY75fqDeE_g&list=PLFS9HYSdiJiDBDKtfks_q_fWqZ3ZyZ7Xy) which you can follow along and **build your first dApp** in **< 1 hr** in the simplest way possible ü§Ø

&nbsp; 

We have also created a boilerplate npm package **[create-kava-dapp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-kava-dapp)** which you can use to create an end to end dApp in one line of code using **npx-create-kava-dapp**. You can see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A7FuRNOys0&list=PLFS9HYSdiJiDBDKtfks_q_fWqZ3ZyZ7Xy&index=4) for reference on how to use it.
